## My take on Codex's pre-qualification exercises

With the time and knowledge I had available, I was able to complete exercises from 1 to 3. I decided to solve them using Java, which is one of the languages I'm most familiar with (along Python).

Below, you can find how to run the code I wrote.

In both Java projects (ex1 and ex2-3), there are two classes, one representing the main resolution of the exercise and the other being a tester class. The second one has small tests in its main function, mainly the ones required on the PDF.

To run both exercises without installing extra software, open repl.it, select Java as the coding language, drag and drop each file on the side bar (files bar) and press the "Run" button present above.

The terminal on the right side will print the results from each exercise.
